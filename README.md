## Executive Summary

This analysis evaluates the Maji Ndogo water access and infrastructure project, focusing on water accessibility levels, infrastructure improvements, and resource allocation. Using **Power BI** for data visualization and **MySQL** for data processing, we analyzed water access metrics, project completion rates, and geographical insights to support data-driven decision-making for improving water service delivery in underserved areas.

---

## Project Objectives and Scope

The project aims to:

1. **Evaluate Water Accessibility**: Assess the percentage of people with access to basic water services.
2. **Track Project Completion**: Analyze the status and completion rate of water infrastructure projects.
3. **Determine Budget Allocation**: Monitor costs by province and improvement type to ensure efficient fund distribution.
4. **Optimize Service Delivery**: Use geographical insights to improve infrastructure in underserved areas.

Data spans several years, emphasizing seasonal water demand patterns and infrastructure needs across regions.

## Data Sources and Preparation

### Data Sources:
- **Project Progress Database**: Records on project completion, town names, and improvement types.
- **Infrastructure Cost Database**: Costs associated with infrastructure improvements by category and province.
- **Demographic and Geographical Data**: Population served, province details, and distance data.

### Data Preparation Steps:
- **Standardizing Locations and Categories**: Merged inconsistent names for towns and improvement types.
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicates and filtered out incomplete or canceled projects.
- **Budget Allocation Calculations**: Used **MySQL** to determine regional budget needs and categorize improvement types based on adjusted costs.
- **MySQL for Efficiency**: Migrated datasets to **MySQL** for real-time updates in **Power BI**, especially for regional distance and budgeting calculations.

## Key Metrics and Analytical Approach

### Key Metrics:
1. **Basic Water Access Level**: Percentage of people with access to water services across regions.
2. **Project Completion Rate**: Tracks the number of completed projects (currently at 29).
3. **Budget Allocation**: Costs analyzed by province and project type for efficient resource distribution.
4. **Population Reach**: Percentage of the population served, focusing on underserved regions.

### Analytical Approach:
- **Percentage Analysis**: Calculated water access percentages.
- **Geographical Segmentation**: Analyzed access levels and budgets at the provincial level.
- **Geographical Insights**: Identified gaps in water access for underserved areas.
